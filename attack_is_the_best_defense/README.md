Attack is the best defense

This project basically encompasses the use of Docker in scripting and also emphasises on Network basics in constraining all forms of Cyber/Malicious Attacks while networking on the internet.

Below were the files created and their expected outputs;

0-sniffing - Writes a Script that executes user_authenticating_into_server locally on my machine and, using tcpdump, sniffs the network to find my password.

1-dictionary_attack - Since Password-based authentication systems can be easily broken by using a dictionary attack, this file contains the answer to a Script that finds my own password dictionary. (Letâ€™s try it on an SSH account).
